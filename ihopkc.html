      <h1>What is IHOPKC?</h1>
      <p>A look at the ministry, mission, and heart behind the International House of Prayer of Kansas City.</p>
    </header>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Origins & Mission</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>IHOPKC</strong> (International House of Prayer of Kansas City) began on May 7, 1999, when a small group of full-time intercessors committed to worship and prayer for 13 hours a day. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
      </p>
      <p>
        Just a few months later, on September 19, 1999, the ministry expanded to a full 24/7 schedule — a continuous prayer and worship movement that has remained active through live worship teams ever since. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
      </p>
      <p>
        IHOPKC’s mission involves much more than prayer: intercession, evangelism, discipleship, healing the sick, feeding the poor, and impacting all spheres of society — from family and education to arts, media, government, and more. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>24/7 Prayer & Worship</h2>
      <p>
        The core of IHOPKC is the <em>Global Prayer Room</em> — a sanctuary of continuous worship and intercession staffed by prayer leaders, musicians, and worship teams. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
      </p>
      <p>
        Their prayer rhythm flows in two-hour worship and intercession sets, rotating round the clock, day and night. This “harp & bowl” model is inspired by the vision in Revelation of unceasing worship before God’s throne. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
      </p>
      <p>
        Through their livestream, people worldwide can join in — allowing the prayer room’s influence to stretch far beyond Kansas City. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Community, Outreach & Impact</h2>

      <p>
        IHOPKC doesn't limit itself to prayer — it has historically equipped and sent out “intercessory missionaries” who engage in evangelism, mercy ministries, outreach to the poor, and social justice efforts around the globe. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
      </p>
      <p>
        Their vision is to rejoice before God in worship, intercede for the nations, and practically demonstrate the gospel through love, service, and compassion — reflecting God’s heart for the world. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How You Can Connect or Participate</h2>
      <p>
        You can join the Global Prayer Room online — through live streams available 24/7 for worship, prayer, and spiritual encouragement. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
      </p>
      <p>
        Many individuals are drawn to IHOPKC seeking deeper intimacy with God, community, missions training, and opportunities to serve. Their community emphasizes close fellowship, devotion, and shared vision. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you feel called to intercessory prayer, worship, or missions — this ministry offers a place to grow, connect, and take part in what God is doing around the world.
